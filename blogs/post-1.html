                <p>
                    In Refined Vanilla, we automate everything. Our farms are seamless, our storage is sorted by
                    machines. But as we all know, the <strong>Sand Dupe</strong> is patched (nice try with those
                    pistons). This means the only way to get sand is manual labor. But why should <em>you</em> do it?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Introducing the most renewable, non-Redstone resource on the server: <strong>The Desperate
                        Noob.</strong>
                </p>

                <h2>Step 1: The "Interview" at Spawn</h2>
                <p>
                    Head to the spawn region. Look for players who are punching trees with their fists or asking "Where
                    can I build?". These are your prime candidates. Do not offer them diamonds; that scares them. Offer
                    them a <strong>Stone Shovel</strong> and tell them you have a "job opportunity" in resource
                    management.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "A noob will dig for an hour for a single golden apple. An expert knows that hour is worth three
                    double-chests of TNT."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Step 2: The Voting Loophole (Genius)</h2>
                <p>
                    Here is where the pro-strategy comes in. Your "Sand Slaves" will eventually want better tools or
                    food. Tell them that the only way to get "server points" for rewards is to <strong>vote for the
                        server</strong> on the voting sites.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>They vote for the server, thinking they are earning points.</li>
                    <li>The server ranking goes up.</li>
                    <li>More new players (fresh supply of slaves) join the server.</li>
                    <li>You send the new players to the desert. The cycle continues.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    You are not just getting sand; you are building a self-sustaining ecosystem of manual labor. It's
                    capitalism at its finest.
                </p>

                <h2>Step 3: Maintaining the Illusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Occasionally, visit their digging site. Give them a piece of bread. Tell them they are "integral to
                    the clan's infrastructure." Then fly back to your base and laugh. Remember: if they ever complain,
                    just remind them that the desert is vast, and graves are easy to dig.
                </p>
